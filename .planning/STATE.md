# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Summoner profiles with comprehensive stats — the foundation that enables the desktop app to be built against this API

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation (Data Infrastructure & API Safety)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 - Foundation
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-02 - Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: █░░░░░░░░░ 25% (1/4 plans in phase)

## Performance Metrics

**Requirements:**
- Total v1 requirements: 21
- Requirements complete: 0
- Requirements remaining: 21

**Phases:**
- Total phases: 5
- Phases complete: 0
- Current phase: Phase 1

**Velocity:**
- Not yet measured

## Recent Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01 | L1 TTL (5min) shorter than L2 TTL (1hr) | Prevents stale-distributed-fresh scenarios where one server has stale in-memory cache but Redis has updated data |
| 01 | Use HybridCache built-in stampede protection | No manual locking needed - HybridCache guarantees only one concurrent caller executes factory for given key |
| 01 | CacheService wrapper abstraction | Centralizes cache key generation, improves testability, provides domain-specific API over infrastructure |

## Pending Todos

## Context for Next Session

**What we just did:**
- Created roadmap with 5 phases (compressed from research's 6 phases for "quick" depth)
- Mapped all 21 v1 requirements to phases (100% coverage)
- Derived goal-backward success criteria for each phase

**Phase 1 priority:** Foundation work addresses rate limiting, caching, and data retention—critical pitfalls that have no recovery if handled incorrectly. This phase must succeed before any downstream features.

**Brownfield reminder:** Existing code has basic summoner refresh flow. Phase 2 will polish existing features rather than build from scratch.
