## Recent Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 02-04 | Items padded to 7 slots with 0s | MatchParticipantItem lacks Slot property - pad to consistent length (6 items + trinket) for UI |
| 02-04 | Rune summary vs full detail | Match cards show keystone+styles, full rune tree available via match detail endpoint |
| 02-04 | Batched queries for items/runes | 3 queries (participants, items, runes) prevents N+1 performance issues |
| 02-03 | 5-minute stats TTL (2min L1) | Shorter than profile/rank because stats aggregate from frequently-updated match data |
| 02-03 | 1-hour match detail TTL (15min L1) | Match data is immutable once stored, can cache longer |
| 02-03 | Eager invalidation of known cache keys | HybridCache lacks wildcard support - invalidate common parameter combinations on refresh |
| 02-03 | Extract ComputeXxx methods for cache factories | Keeps cache logic separate from business logic, follows GetOrCreateAsync pattern cleanly |
| 02-02 | Champion name placeholder "Champion {id}" | Phase 3 will add proper static data service for name resolution |
| 02-02 | StatsAge from most recent match date | FetchedAt uses first match MatchDate from RecentMatches for freshness indication |
| 02-02 | Task.WhenAll for parallel stats fetching | Minimizes latency by fetching overview, champions, recent concurrently |
| 02-01 | Rune style via RuneVersion lookup | Current MatchParticipantRune only stores RuneId - use RunePathId from static data to infer primary/sub |
| 02-01 | Flat item list without slots | Items stored deduplicated without slot positions, returned as simple list |
| 02-01 | Private RuneMetadata record | Type-safe alternative to dynamic for rune lookup results |
| 01 | L1 TTL (5min) shorter than L2 TTL (1hr) | Prevents stale-distributed-fresh scenarios where one server has stale in-memory cache but Redis has updated data |
| 01 | Use HybridCache built-in stampede protection | No manual locking needed - HybridCache guarantees only one concurrent caller executes factory for given key |
| 01 | CacheService wrapper abstraction | Centralizes cache key generation, improves testability, provides domain-specific API over infrastructure |
| 01 | 6-hour patch check interval | Satisfies requirement while minimizing API calls - patch cycle is ~2 weeks, hourly checks waste 95% of requests |
| 01 | 30-day cache TTL for static data | Outlives 2-week patch cycle, old patch data persists for historical queries |
| 01 | IsActive flag for current patch | Simplifies queries to FirstOrDefault(p => p.IsActive) instead of ordering by ReleaseDate |
| 01 | Tag-based cache invalidation | Cache entries tagged with patch version allow bulk invalidation on patch change |
| 01 | Exponential backoff delays: 30s, 60s, 120s, 300s | Balances responsiveness with API courtesy - first retry quick for transient failures, backs off if issue persists |
| 01 | Max 5 retry attempts before PermanentlyUnfetchable | Prevents infinite retry loops while being persistent - after ~10 minutes data likely permanently unavailable |
| 01 | 2-year retention window check before fetch | Riot API only retains match data for 2 years - checking before fetch prevents wasted API calls |
| 01 | Global query filter for PermanentlyUnfetchable | Unfetchable matches are historical records but shouldn't appear in normal queries - use IgnoreQueryFilters() for admin/reporting |
| 01 | Trust Camille SDK rate limiting | Camille parses X-Rate-Limit-* headers and respects Retry-After - custom throttling creates double-throttling |
| 01 | RetryFailedMatchesJob hourly as safety net | Catches edge cases from service restarts - primary retry is per-match exponential backoff |
| 01 | Separate ProfileAge and RankAge metadata | Profile data changes rarely, rank data changes frequently - different freshness expectations |
| 01 | Human-friendly age descriptions | Just now (<5 min), X minutes ago (<1 hr), X hours ago (<1 day), X days ago (>1 day) for UI display |
| 01 | UpdatedAt on Summoner entity | Added for ProfileAge tracking - was missing but required by plan |
| 01 | API contract change to SummonerProfileResponse | Acceptable in Phase 1 Foundation - no existing clients to break, desktop app will be built against this contract |

## Context for Next Session

**What we just did:**
- Completed Phase 2 (Summoner Profiles) with 4 plans:
  - 02-01: Full match details endpoint with items/runes/spells
  - 02-02: Complete profile response in single API call with parallel fetching
  - 02-03: HybridCache for all stats queries (sub-500ms performance)
  - 02-04: Match history with loadout data (items, runes, spells)

**Phase 2 deliverables:**
- Profile endpoint: `/api/summoners/{region}/{name}/{tag}` returns complete profile
- Match detail endpoint: `/api/summoners/{id}/matches/{matchId}` returns full loadout
- Match history: `/api/summoners/{id}/matches/recent` with items/runes/spells
- Stats cached with HybridCache (5min TTL), invalidated on refresh
- All verification criteria passed (15/15 must-haves)

**Verification report:** `.planning/phases/02-summoner-profiles/02-VERIFICATION.md`

**Ready for:** Phase 3 planning - Champion Analytics (win rates, builds, tier lists, matchups)
