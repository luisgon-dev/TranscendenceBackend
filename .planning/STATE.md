## Session Continuity

## Context for Next Session

**What we just did:**
- Created roadmap with 5 phases (compressed from research's 6 phases for "quick" depth)
- Mapped all 21 v1 requirements to phases (100% coverage)
- Derived goal-backward success criteria for each phase

**Phase 1 priority:** Foundation work addresses rate limiting, caching, and data retention—critical pitfalls that have no recovery if handled incorrectly. This phase must succeed before any downstream features.

**Brownfield reminder:** Existing code has basic summoner refresh flow. Phase 2 will polish existing features rather than build from scratch.
